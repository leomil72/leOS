leOS (little embedded Operating System)

This is not a complete OS nor an RTOS as you usually know but it's a simple
scheduler to schedule the execution of little routines in background, so that
you can forget about them. It's designed for Arduino and other common Atmel
microcontrollers (for the complete list please read below).

***********************
How to use it - Methods

Unpack the library and copy it into your /libraries folder, that usually is in
your sketchs' folder. Then include the library and create a new istance of it
by adding the following code at the top of your sketch:

#include "leOS.h"
leOS myOS

Then you have to initialize the library in the setup() routine:
void setup() {
  myOS.begin();
  .....
}

Now you can add a task by simply call the method .addTask():
void setup() {
  myOS.begin();
  myOS.addTask(yourFunction, scheduleTime[, status]);
  ...
}

yourFunction must be a routine that is inside your sketch. scheduleTime is
the scheduled interval in milliseconds at which you want your routine
to be executed. Starting from version 0.1.3, now the user can choose the status
of the task when it adds it to the scheduler. status can be: PAUSED, for a task
that doesn't have to start immediately; SCHEDULED (default option), for a normal
task that has to start after its scheduling; ONETINE, for a task that has to
run only once.
An interesting feature is the ability to run one-time tasks. A one-time task
is a task that will be run only once: the scheduler, once it has run the task,
will remove it from the running tasks (it won't be paused, it will be permanently
deleted).


To pause a task, just call the following method:
myOS.pauseTask(yourFunction);

You can restart it with:
myOS.restartTask(yourFunction);

To remove a task from the scheduler call this method:
myOS.removeTask(yourFunction);

To modify a running task, simply call the modifyTask method with the new interval time
and/or the kind of the status' task, i.e. a normal or a one-time task:
myOS.modifyTask(yourFunction, newInterval [, newTaskStatus]);

newTaskStatus can be ONETIME if you decide to transform a normal task into a
one-time task, or SCHEDULED if you want to transform a one-time task into
a normal task (the one-time has still to be executed).


To check if a task is running, you have to use the taskIsRunning() method:
myOS.getTaskStatus(yourFunction);

This will return 255 if there was an error (task not found) or a value for the
current status:
PAUSED - task is paused/not running
SCHEDULED - task is running
ONETIME - task is scheduled to run in a near future.
SCHEDULED_IMMEDIATESTART or simply IMMEDIATESTART, for a task that has to
be executed once it has been added to the scheduler.

Introduced with leOS 1.1.0 there are 2 new methods that permit to stop/restart
the scheduler, useful if you need to stop all the running tasks at the
same time:

myOS.haltScheduler();
stops the scheduler and freezes all the tasks preserving their current
intervals;

myOS.restartScheduler();
restarts the scheduler resuming all the tasks that were running.


*Be careful*: the user is asked to check his code to avoid strange situations when
he pauses a task. I.e.: if the task that has been paused alternated the output of
a pin and that pin drove an external circuit, the user should check if the status
of the pin after the task has been paused is safe and compatible with his needs.


***********************
32-/64-bit math

Starting with version 0.1.1, the user can choose between 32-bit and 64-bit math.
Using 32-bit math, the maximum interval that can be choosed is limited to 49.7 days;
the overflow of the counter has been fixed since versione 1.0.1.

While using 64-bit math the maximum that can be choosen is only limited by the
user's fantasy, due to the fact that the 64-bit counter will overflow after
584,942,417 years (default maximum interval is 1 hour, but you can change this
value editing the leOS::addTask method inside the leOS.cpp file).

To switch between 32-bit and 64-bit math just comment/uncomment the line
#define SIXTYFOUR_MATH

that is present at the beginning of the code inside the leOS.h file.

***********************
How it works

The scheduler makes use of a 8-bit timer of the microcontroller to schedule the user's tasks,
so you'll loose PWM functionalities on the related pins. This is a list of the
timers used on each microcontroller and the pins that you cannot use as PWM
pins anymore:
1) Atmega48/88/168/328 (Arduino UNO/2009): timer 2 - pins 5 & 17 (pins D3 & D11 on Arduino UNO)
2) Atmega344/644/1284: timer 2 - pins 20 & 21 (pins D14 & D15 on Maniacbug core)
3) Atmega640/1280/1281/2560/2561: timer 2 - pins 18 & 23 (pins D9 & D10 an Arduino MEGA)
4) Attiny25/45/85: timer 0 - pins 5 & 6 (pins D0 & D1 on Tiny core)
5) Attiny2313/4313: timer 0 - pins 9 & 14 (pins D7 & D11 on Tiny core)
6) Attiny24/44/84: timer 0 - pins 5 & 6 (pins D2 & D3 on Tiny core)
7) Atmega8: timer 2 - pins 17 (pin D11 on older Arduino boards)
8) Atmega32U4 (Arduino Leonardo): timer 3 - pin 32 (pin D5 on Arduino Leonardo)

The user has to remember that he has to create simple tasks that:
1) don't use any other interrupts/timers inside them (due to the fact that an interrupt
service routine, ISR, is atomic - this means that it cannot be halted or
interrupted by another interrupt);
2) don't use PWM functionalities on the pins listed above;
3) don't keep too much running time - this is important because a task that
runs for a long time will freeze the execution of the other tasks and the
main loop.


***********************
Supported microcontrollers

Actually the library has been successfully tested with Arduino UNO, Atmega328,
Arduino MEGA2560 and Arduino Leonardo.
The library should compile and work versus the following:
- Attiny2313/4313
- Attiny24/44/84
- Attiny25/45/85
- Atmega344/644/1284/P
- Atmega8/A
- Atmega48/88/168/328/P
- Atmega640/1280/1281/2560/2561
- Atmega32U4 (only at 16 MHz)

Supported clocks are 1, 4, 8, and 16 MHz.

NOTE:
To use leOS on Attiny 24/44/84 microcontrollers you have to modify a file of the Tiny
core to move the millis() and delay() functions from timer 0 to timer 1.
To do that, open the file /arduino-your_version/hardware/tiny/cores/tiny/core_build_options.c
and look for the section "Build options for the ATtiny84 processor".
A couple of rows below, change this line
#define TIMER_TO_USE_FOR_MILLIS                   1

to
#define TIMER_TO_USE_FOR_MILLIS                   0
then save the file and reload the Arduino IDE.
